NetSuite ClientScript for Record Validation and Saving
Overview

This ClientScript is designed to enhance form interactions within NetSuite by implementing custom validation logic before saving a record. The primary focus of this script is to ensure that specific conditions are met for 'customer' record types, specifically ensuring that a sales representative is associated with the record before it is saved.
Features

    Record Validation: Validates that each customer record has at least one sales representative listed in the 'salesteam' sublist before the record can be saved.

Script Functions
saveRecord(scriptContext)

This function is triggered before a record is saved. It performs the following checks and actions:

    Checks if the record type is 'customer'.
    Validates that there is at least one entry in the 'salesteam' sublist.
    Ensures that each entry in the 'salesteam' sublist has a sales representative associated with it.
    Provides user alerts if the validation fails, indicating that the record cannot be saved without meeting the specified conditions.

Installation and Setup

    Upload Script: Upload the .js file containing the script to your NetSuite SuiteScripts directory.
    Create Script Record:
        Navigate to Customization > Scripting > Scripts and click New.
        Select Client Script as the script type and link it to the uploaded .js file.
    Deploy Script:
        Create a new script deployment for the script record.
        Associate the deployment with the record types that require this validation, typically 'customer' records.
        Configure the deployment settings as needed to specify which forms or views should trigger this script.

Usage

Once deployed, the script automatically validates customer records on save. If the conditions specified in the saveRecord function are not met, the script will alert the user and prevent the record from being saved.
Limitations

    The script is currently tailored only for 'customer' record types. If needed for other record types, modifications to the script logic will be necessary.
    The validation checks only the 'salesteam' sublist. If your business logic requires additional checks, further customization of the script will be needed.

Troubleshooting

    Validation Errors Not Triggering: Ensure that the script is properly deployed and associated with the correct record types and forms.
    Unexpected Behavior: Check the browser's console for errors that may indicate issues with script execution or logic errors.

For further assistance or customizations, consider consulting with a NetSuite professional or a developer familiar with SuiteScript.
